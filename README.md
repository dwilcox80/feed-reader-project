## How to run this test
There are two different ways to run these tests:

### Option 1
1. Click "Clone in Desktop" / "Download ZIP"
2. Once cloned/downloaded, open the folder
3. Open the index.html file in your preferred browser
4. The test results are at the bottom of the screen.  

_For fun, try changing some of the areas that are being tested up to see how it affects the specs_
